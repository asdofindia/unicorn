# unicorn

"unicorn" is our sweet little name for **Unified Communications Over Real-time Networks**.

unicorn's purpose is to dissolve fragmentation of the internet; by
making it possible to bridge together different types of networks. It
aims to be a data-agnostic communications technology platform that can
connect any number and combination of clients (humans or machines).

The unicorn platform will use a federated architecture with
distributed points of discovery. Security will be baked into every
layer. It will work with technologies like WebRTC and inter-operate
with technologies like [Matrix](http://matrix.org), and extend
them to enhance interoperability of communication.

It aims to be agnostic of data-type. If the data type can be streamed,
unicorn will be able to support it. This means, it will work for
audio, video, text or binary data.
